# Digilys playbook

Ansible playbook for provisioning a production environment server for Digilys.

## Limitations

Currently, this playbook is designed to run on a single server, without any HA
configuration of either the application or the database. The playbook, however,
is prepared for implementing HA and multiple servers in the future.
